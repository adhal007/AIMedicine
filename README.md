## AI for Medicine Specialization 

#### Course I: AI for medical diagnosis

Scope: 

- Learning to build machine learning/Deep learning models for diagnosis
- Build an algorithm to look at chest X-ray and determine if it's a disease
- Another algorithm: Look at brain MRI's and identify tumors 
- WEEK 1: build a deep learning model that can interpret chest X-rays to classify different disease causes 
- WEEK 2: Evaluation strategies to assess quality of your model 
- WEEK 3: Image segmentation to identify location and boundaries of tumors  


#### Next steps

1. Build a pre-processor utility for image visualization and exploration (done)
2. Make an environment for tensorflow/keras usable for deep learning applications  (done)
